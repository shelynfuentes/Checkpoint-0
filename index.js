// Strings

/* 
First, declare variable named firstName.
var firstName


Assign firstName to a string value of your first name.
var firstName = "firstName";
Declare another variable named lastName and assign it the value of your last name.
var lastName = "lastName";
Then declare another variable named fullName and assign it to the current value of firstName and lastName and have the joined values separated with a space character.
Remember that computer languages will not add the space character for you so how would you do that manually?
*/
var fullName = firstName + '' + lastName 



//Numbers
/*
Declare a variable named luckyNumber.
Assign luckyNumber to a number of your choice.
Declare another variable named luckyNumberTimes2 and assign it the value of luckyNumber multiplied by 2.
*/
var luckyNumber
luckyNumber = 4
var luckyNumberTimes2 = luckyNumber * 2;

//Booleans
/*
Declare a variable named myBool and assign it the value of true.
Then, declare another named isEqualTo and assign it the value of strictly comparing luckyNumber and luckyNumberTimes2.
*/
var myBool = true;
var isEqualTo = luckyNumber === luckyNumberTimes2
